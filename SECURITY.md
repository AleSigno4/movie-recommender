## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. 
Reporting vulnerabilities publicly can put all users at risk.

Instead, please report it privately by:
- Sending an email to **alesignori4@gmail.com**
- Providing a brief description of the steps to reproduce the issue.

I will acknowledge your report and work on a fix as soon as possible. Thank you for helping keep this project safe!
